# 📊 Telecom Finance Forecasting (In Progress)

## Project Summary

### What is this project?
This is an in-progress project about understanding telecom revenue and forecasting trends.

### Why is it interesting?
A company can plan better when it understands past revenue and usage patterns.

### How does it work?
The proposed workflow prepares revenue and usage data, computes business measures, and applies forecasting models.

### Real-life example
A telecom team wants to estimate next-quarter revenue using past records.

### What did I learn?
I am exploring revenue analysis, time-series forecasting, and visual reporting.

## Technical Documentation


This project aims to forecast and analyze key financial KPIs in the telecom industry using advanced data science methodologies. Built using real-world data from the Kaggle Telecom Revenue Assurance Dataset, this work aligns with the Deutsche Telekom “Start up!” trainee program, emphasizing finance, analytics, and actionable business outcomes.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Forecast telecom revenue trends using time-series models (Prophet, ARIMA)
- Engineer meaningful KPIs: ARPU, ROI, Plan Mix, Revenue per Usage Unit
- Train ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for revenue prediction
- Visualize results in an interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Deploy the pipeline using Docker for portability and reproducibility
