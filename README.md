# 📊 Telecom Finance Forecasting (In Progress)

## Project Summary

Imagine a telecom company trying to plan its revenue for the coming months. It needs to understand past income, subscriptions, and customer usage. This in-progress project explores how data analysis and forecasting could help with that. The challenge is turning different business records into useful measures and future estimates.

The planned workflow prepares the data, studies revenue trends, and tries forecasting methods. For example, a team could use past information to estimate next quarter's revenue. I am learning how time-based prediction and financial analysis work together. This repository is still in progress, so planned features are not presented as completed results.

## Technical Documentation


This project aims to forecast and analyze key financial KPIs in the telecom industry using advanced data science methodologies. Built using real-world data from the Kaggle Telecom Revenue Assurance Dataset, this work aligns with the Deutsche Telekom “Start up!” trainee program, emphasizing finance, analytics, and actionable business outcomes.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Forecast telecom revenue trends using time-series models (Prophet, ARIMA)
- Engineer meaningful KPIs: ARPU, ROI, Plan Mix, Revenue per Usage Unit
- Train ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for revenue prediction
- Visualize results in an interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Deploy the pipeline using Docker for portability and reproducibility
